One Pan Pasta: Tomato, Basil and Burrata Spaghetti

slightly adapted from Martha Stewart 
serves 4-6 prep time: 10 minutes cook time: 10 minutes total time: 20 minutes

12 OUNCES SPAGHETTI
4 SMALL TOMATOES, QUARTERED
4 CLOVES GARLIC, THINLY SLICED
1/2 TEASPOON RED PEPPER FLAKES
2 TABLESPOONS EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL
4 CUPS WATER, PLUS 1/2 CUP IF NEEDED
COARSE SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER
FRESH BURRATA, TO FINISH
FRESH BASIL, TO FINISH

Combine the pasta, tomatoes, garlic, red pepper flakes, oil and water in a large heavy bottomed pan or pot (large enough to fit the pasta in without breaking).

Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil, stirring and flipping pasta with tongs until pasta is al dente and cooked through and water as nearly evaporated, about 8-9 minutes. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Enjoy hot with fresh burrata, basil, and a tiny drizzle of olive oil, if desired.

*If your pasta is too dry without it cooking all the way through, add in the extra 1/2 cup of water during the cooking time.
