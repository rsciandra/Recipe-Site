Mini Ham and Cheese Croque Monsieur Puff Pastry Tarts Recipe
 makes 12-16 mini tarts prep time: 30 minutes cook time: 15 minutes total time: 45 minutes

1 1/2 TABLESPOONS BUTTER
2 TABLESPOONS FLOUR
1 CUP MILK
1 – 2 TABLESPOONS FRENCH’S SWEET YELLOW MUSTARD OR SPICY YELLOW MUSTARD
SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE
1 SHEET PUFF PASTRY, THAWED
12-16 THIN SLICES OF HAM
1 CUP SHREDDED GRUYÈRE
1 EGG, LIGHTLY BEATEN WITH A SPLASH OF WATER
ADDITIONAL 1 – 2 TABLESPOONS FRENCH’S SWEET YELLOW MUSTARD OR SPICY YELLOW MUSTARD, TO SPREAD IF DESIRED
FRESH THYME SPRIGS, IF DESIRED

Preheat your oven to 425°F.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and stir constantly for about three minutes, until completely smooth and incorporated. Pour in the milk in thin stream while whisking. Keep on medium heat, whisking, for about 5-10 minutes, until the sauce thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the mustard, taste and season with salt and pepper.

Use a round cookie cutter to cut out 2 inch rounds of puff pastry. Use a smaller cookie cutter to score a circle inside each round without cutting down all the way through. Gently poke the centre hole with a fork to dock.

Top each round with a bit of mustard béchamel, a bit of ham, and shredded cheese. Top with a sprinkle of fresh pepper.

Use a pastry brush to brush the rounds with the egg lightly beaten with a splash of water. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden and puffy. Enjoy hot with extra mustard and fresh thyme sprigs, if desired.
