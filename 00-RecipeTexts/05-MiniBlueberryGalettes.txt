slightly adapted from Bon Appetit
 makes 8 mini galettes prep time: 30 minutes bake time: 45 minutes total time: 1 hour 15 minutes

Dough

1/4 CUP PISTACHIOS
1/2 CUP PLUS 1 TABLESPOON ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
1 TEASPOON SUGAR
1/4 TEASPOON KOSHER SALT
1/8 TEASPOON GROUND CINNAMON
1/4 CUP (1/2 STICK) CHILLED UNSALTED BUTTER, CUT INTO PIECES

Filling

ABOUT 1 CUP BLUEBERRIES
1/2 TABLESPOON CORNSTARCH
SCANT TEASPOON FRESH LIME JUICE
1 TABLESPOON SUGAR
1 TABLESPOONS MILK, HALF-AND-HALF, OR HEAVY CREAM
RAW SUGAR, TO SPRINKLE, IF DESIRED

Preheat oven to 375°F. Roughly chop the pistachios. In a large bowl, combine the pistachios, flour, sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Cut in the butter until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces remaining.

Drizzle with 2 tablespoons ice water and mix, adding another splash of water if needed, until dough comes together. Divide into eight balls and pat into disks. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.

In a bowl, toss the blueberries, cornstarch, lime juice, and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a large bowl.

Roll out the disks of dough on a lightly floured surface and carefully transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Mound blueberries in center and fold edges over, overlapping slightly. Brush dough with milk and sprinkle with sugar, if desired.
 
Bake galette until crust is dark golden brown and filling is bubbling, 35-45 minutes. Let cool before serving. Enjoy with ice cream, if desired!
