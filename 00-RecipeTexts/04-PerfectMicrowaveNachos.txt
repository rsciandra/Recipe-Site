Perfect Microwave Nachos Recipe
 serves 2, generously prep time: 15 minutes active time: 5 minutes total time: 20 minutes

TORTILLA CHIPS OF CHOICE
1/2 CUP COOKED SEASONED GROUND TACO MEAT
1/2 -3/4 CUPS SHREDDED CHEDDAR AND MOZZARELLA
SLICED GREEN ONIONS
JALAPENO SLICES
1/2 AVOCADO, CUBED
ROUGHLY CHOPPED CILANTRO
SOUR CREAM
SALSA

Arrange your chips in a single layer on a microwavable plate. Add a bit of ground beef to each chip then top with a generous amount of cheese. Add one slice of jalapeño and a pinch of sliced green onions to each chip. Microwave (1-2 minutes, depending on microwave) until cheese is melty, but not over cooked and crispy. You want the cheese to be still stringy. I start with 1 minute and then do 30 second intervals until it’s melted to my liking. Top each chip with a cube of avocado, a sprinkle of cilantro, and a dab each of sour cream and salsa. Enjoy!

Notes: Usually I would obsessively arrange toppings on flat round tortilla chips, which isn’t as neat and tidy. Scoops are a total game changer! For the ground beef, I just browned some up with a bit of garlic powder, paprika, cayenne, cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper. Feel free to make up a big batch with taco seasoning. Or, even better, if you have left over taco meat, this is perfect!
