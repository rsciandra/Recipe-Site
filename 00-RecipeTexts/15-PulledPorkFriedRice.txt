Pulled Pork Fried Rice Recipe

serves 2

OIL
SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER
3 EGGS
1 CUP PULLED PORK OR MEAT OF CHOICE
2 CUPS RICE, PREFERABLY DAY OLD
1 CUP PEAS (FROZEN IS FINE)
1 JALAPEÑO, SLICED
SRIRACHA, IF DESIRED

Crack your eggs into a bowl and whisk. Season with salt and pepper. In a large skillet or wok, heat up a bit of oil over high heat and scramble your eggs until mostly set, but still slightly runny. The eggs will cook a bit more when you fry all the ingredients together. Remove and set aside.

If the skillet is dry, add a tiny bit more oil and then add the pulled pork. Fry over medium high until crispy and hot. Add the rice and fry, stirring occasionally and breaking up the rice until the rice is crispy and heated through.

Add the eggs, peas, and sliced jalapeños into the skillet and fry and mix until everything is evenly distributed. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve with sriracha, if desired.

NOTES:

It may not be traditional, but if you don’t have a wok, I recommend frying rice in a non-stick skillet as opposed to an uncoated frying pan. Most traditional woks (carbon steel or cast iron) end up being virtually non-stick from years of heat and oil. Non-stick means less oil, which can be a good thing.
