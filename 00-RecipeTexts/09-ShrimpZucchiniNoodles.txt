1 MEDIUM FENNEL BULB, THINLY SLICED LENGTHWISE, FRONDS SAVED
2 CLOVES GARLIC, THINLY SLICED
1/2 TEASPOON CRUSHED RED PEPPER FLAKES, OR MORE TO TASTE

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over high-heat. Add the shrimp, being careful not to crowd the pan, and cook for 1-2 minutes per side, until slight charred, pink, and cooked through. Season generously with salt and pepper and remove from the pan and set aside.

Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the fennel slices and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and soft, 10-12 minutes. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes and half of the lemon slices. Cook until garlic is soft, about 2 minutes. Add the zucchini noodles, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing, until tender and cooked through, 2-3 minutes, depending on thickness of zoodles.

Add the shrimp back into the pan and toss to combine. In a small bowl, toss the cilantro, fennel fronds, and remaining lemon slices with a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and serve on top of the shrimp and zucchini noodles.
