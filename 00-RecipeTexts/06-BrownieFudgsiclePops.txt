Brownies

Position rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 325°F. Line 8x8x2-inch metal baking pan with foil, pressing foil firmly against pan sides and leaving 2-inch overhang. Coat foil with nonstick spray. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Continue cooking until butter stops foaming and browned bits form at bottom of pan, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; immediately add sugar, cocoa, 2 teaspoons water, vanilla, and 1/4 teaspoon (generous) salt. Stir to blend. Let cool 5 minutes (mixture will still be hot). Add eggs to hot mixture 1 at a time, beating vigorously to blend after each addition. When mixture looks thick and shiny, add flour and stir until blended. Beat vigorously 60 strokes. Stir in nuts. Transfer batter to prepared pan.

Bake brownies until toothpick inserted into center comes out almost clean (with a few moist crumbs attached), about 25 minutes. Cool in pan on rack. Using foil overhang, lift brownies from pan. Let fully cool, and cut into chunks.

Fudgesicles

In a heavy-bottomed sauce pan, combine the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt. Add a touch of milk and whisk into a smooth paste. Whisk in the remaining milk until smooth.

Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring with the whisk or silicone spatula. Continue to heat until small bubbles appear at the edges – continue to heat for 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Transfer to a glass measuring cup and let cool. Cut or break the brownies into large chunks and stuff into the bottom of the mold so your popsicle stick has something to rest on. Insert the stick and loosely pack chunks of brownies into the rest of the mold.

Pour the cooled fudgesicle mixture into the molds. Freeze for 6 hours or overnight. To store, remove pops from molds and wrap in plastic wrap and keep frozen.
