SLICES OF GOOD QUALITY BREAD, AS NEEDED
FRESH GOAT CHEESE
ROASTED CHERRY TOMATOES
REDUCED BALSAMIC VINEGAR
FRESH BASIL
OLIVE OIL
SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE

Toast the bread. I like to toast mine up in a pan: drizzle a tiny bit of oil in a pan and heat over medium. Place the bread in the hot oil and toast, keeping an eye on it, until golden brown and crisp. Flip.

Spread the goat cheese on to the toast and top with balsamic, basil, a drizzle of oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy immediately!
