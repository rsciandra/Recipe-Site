Chinese Sausage Carbonara Recipe

serves 2

2 LINKS OF CHINESE SAUSAGE, CHOPPED
1 LARGE EGG
1/4 CUP FRESHLY GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE
FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER
4 OZ SPAGHETTI OR LONG PASTA OF CHOICE
1 GREEN ONION, SLICED

Start by boiling a pot of salted water.

In a large bowl, lightly beat the egg. Add the cheese and a liberal grinding of pepper. Mix thoroughly.

Cooking your pasta according to the package. Time it so that everything else is prepared by the time the pasta is cooked.

While the pasta is cooking, fry the chopped sausage in a large sauté pan over medium to medium-high heat until it starts to crisp at the edges.

When the pasta is cooked, drain (being sure to save some pasta water). Add the cooked pasta to the sauté pan and toss to coat each strand in the rendered fat. Pour the pasta and sausage into the bowl with the egg and toss rapidly, coating the strands well. If needed, add a bit of hot reserved pasta water to help melt the cheese and cook the egg. Serve immediately with an extra sprinkle of pepper and the sliced green onions.
