Matcha Coconut Macaroons Recipe

makes 28 cookies

2 2/3 CUP UNSWEETENED SHREDDED COCONUT
2/3 CUP SUGAR
1/3 CUP FLOUR
4 EGG WHITES
1 TABLESPOON MATCHA POWDER

Preheat oven to 325°F.

Combine the coconut, sugar, and flour. Stir in the egg whites. Divide the batter* into two bowls. Sift the matcha into one of the bowls and mix well. Use a cookie scoop to scoop out half a portion of white batter and then scoop out the remaining with green. Place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake for 18-20 minutes or until edges are golden brown. The tops will remain a pure white with little to no browning. Let cool and enjoy!

Notes: It’s not really a batter, it’s quite dry and not at all runny. When you scoop it out with a cookie scoop, it should hold its shape.
