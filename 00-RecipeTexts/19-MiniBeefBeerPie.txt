1/2 CUP (1 STICK) FROZEN BUTTER
1/2 CUP SHREDDED CHEDDAR

Beef and Beer Pie Filling

1 TABLESPOON BUTTER
1/4 ONION, DICED
1 CLOVE GARLIC, MINCED
1/4 POUND GROUND BEEF
1 SMALL CARROT, DICED
1/2 SMALL POTATO, PEELED AND DICED
2 TABLESPOONS FROZEN PEAS, THAWED
1 1/2 TABLESPOONS FLOUR
1/2 CUP OF YOUR FAVOURITE BEER
2 TABLESPOONS TOMATO PASTE
SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER TO TASTE
PINCH OF SUGAR
1 EGG, LIGHTLY BEATEN MIXED WITH A SPLASH OF WATER

Preheat to 350°F.

In a bowl, mix together the flour and salt. Using the coarse side of a box grater, grate the butter into the flour mixture. Stir in the shredded cheddar. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of cold water and stir until crumbly but holds together when squeezed. Add additional ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed. Bring the dough together, shape into a rough rectangle, wrap with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 1 hour minimum.

In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium high heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent and soft, 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add the beef, breaking up and and cooking until brown. Stir in the carrots and potatoes. Sprinkle the flour on the mixture and stir in. Add the beer and tomato paste, stirring often until the mixture thickens up slightly, 5-8 minutes.

Stir in the peas, taste and season with salt, pepper, and a tiny bit of sugar. Let the mixture cool completely.

While the mix is cooling, roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut out 4 circles that are slightly larger than the tins you are using. Re-roll if needed and cut out 4 more slightly smaller circles. Chill until ready to use.

Lightly grease molds and line with the larger circle, pressing down slightly and making sure there is a bit of overhang on the edges. Spoon in a heaping 1/4 cup of the filling and place the smaller circle on top. Crimp the edges. Brush with egg wash and poke or slash a couple of vents to let out steam.

Bake until lightly brown and crisp, about 30-40 minutes, rotating halfway through. Let cool slightly and enjoy warm or at room temperature.

Note: Feel free to use store-bought pie crust – just stir a sprinkle of cheddar into the filling!
