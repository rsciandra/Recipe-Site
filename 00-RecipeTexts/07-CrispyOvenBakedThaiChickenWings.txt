2 POUNDS CHICKEN WINGS
1 TABLESPOON BAKING POWDER
1/2 TEASPOON SALT
2 TABLESPOONS FISH SAUCE
JUICE OF 2 LIMES
2 TABLESPOONS SUGAR
2 CLOVES GARLIC, MINCED
1/2 TSP FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER
1 THAI CHILI PEPPER, OPTIONAL
1/4 CUP CHOPPED CILANTRO
LIME WEDGES, TO SERVE

Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and preheat to 250°F. Set a wire rack into an foil lined rimmed baking sheet. Pat the wings dry with paper towels and place into a large ziplock bag. Combine the baking powder and salt and add to the bag. Seal and toss to evenly coat.

Arrange the wings, skin side up, in a single layer on the rack. Bake on the lower rack for 30 minutes and then move the wings to the upper rack. Increase the temperature to 425°F and roast until golden brown and crispy, 40-50 minutes. Rotate the sheet halfway through baking.

Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, whisk together the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, garlic, and black pepper. Add the wings to the bowl and toss to coat. Enjoy hot!

Note: Using this oven-baked method gives you extra crispy wings, but they aren’t extra juicy. You can also deep-fry your wings and toss them in the dressing if you like a juicier, crispy wing.
