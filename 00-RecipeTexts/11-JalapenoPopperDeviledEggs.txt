Crisp up the pancetta in a non-stick pan over medium heat until edges curl and pancetta is crispy. Set aside. Wipe out the pan and heat over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded cheddar in tiny disks and cook until crispy and golden brown. Remove from the heat and cool in the pan.

Cut the hard boiled eggs in half and remove the yolks from the egg halves into a small bowl. Mash the yolks with a fork until fine and crumbly. Mix with the mayo, cream cheese, jalapeño, green onions and salt and pepper to taste. Fill the egg halves with the yolk mixture and top each egg half with a bit of crispy cheese and pancetta.
