Potato Slider Roll Recipe

slightly adapted from Food.com

yield: 24 buns
prep time: 5 minutes
active time: 20 minutes
total time: 3-4 hours (including proofing time)

5 CUPS ALL PURPOSE FLOUR (625 G)
1 ENVELOPE OR 2 1/4 TEASPOONS (7 G) ACTIVE DRY YEAST
1 1/2 CUPS WATER AT 105-115°F
1/2 CUP MASHED POTATOES (105 G)
1/3 CUP BUTTER, MELTED (75 G)
1/4 CUP SUGAR (50 G)
1 TEASPOON SALT (5.5 G)

In the bowl of a mixer, combine 2 cups of flour with the yeast.

In a small bow, mix together the water, potatoes, butter, sugar, and salt.

Add the wet mix to the flour mix. Beat with the whisk for 30 seconds on low, then for 3 minutes on high.

Switch to the dough hook and add the remaining flour, adding as needed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a ball.

Place in a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 – 24 hours.

Punch the dough lightly and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.

Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces and shape into balls. Gently flatten each piece of dough and shape by bringing in the edges to the centre. Place the ball, seam side down onto a parchment paper lined sheet, leaving 2 inches between. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until nearly doubled in size, about 40 minutes.

Brush tops with an egg whisked with a splash of water.

Bake at 400°F for 16 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
